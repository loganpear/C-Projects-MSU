Title, Year, Rating, Review
Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981, 8.4, There are puzzles to be solved and riddles broken, the dialogue's a joy, beautifully spoken, action-packed from start to end, returns a massive dividend, engaging all the way and thought-provoking.
The Adventures of Tintin, 2011, 7.3, Stunning visuals and a fun adventure, but the story lacks the depth needed for true greatness. It tries to balance action and heart but falls slightly short.
Journey to the Center of the Earth, 2008, 5.8, A shallow plot with over-the-top CGI; the effects are colorful but lack realism. Enjoyable for kids but ultimately forgettable for adults seeking depth.
Mad Max: Fury Road, 2015, 8.1, A relentless thrill ride, visually stunning with powerful performances. The narrative is simple yet gripping, and the action sequences are some of the best ever filmed.
The Golden Compass, 2007, 6.1, Despite its ambitious visuals and creative world-building, it struggles with pacing and underdeveloped characters. It fails to reach the emotional depth it aspires to.
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 1984, 7.6, Thrilling and adventurous with some darker tones, though not as charming as its predecessor. It offers great action but lacks the same emotional resonance.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, 2017, 6.9, A surprisingly fun and self-aware adventure, blending humor with action effectively. It cleverly reinvents the original premise while keeping it accessible for new audiences.
The Mummy, 1999, 7.0, A lighthearted and nostalgic adventure with engaging characters and plenty of action. While it doesn't break new ground, it's an enjoyable and rewatchable classic.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, 2003, 5.8, An interesting concept bogged down by a convoluted plot and mediocre execution. The visuals are decent, but the film lacks a coherent story.
Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, 2010, 5.9, A mediocre adaptation that falls short of capturing the magic of the source material. Its unconvincing performances and weak script make it a disappointment for fans.
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, 2003, 8.0, A thrilling and wildly entertaining adventure with a charismatic lead. The perfect blend of action, humor, and supernatural intrigue makes it an instant classic.
National Treasure, 2004, 6.9, A fun, fast-paced adventure that doesn’t take itself too seriously. While the plot is far-fetched, the treasure hunt is engaging and keeps the momentum going.
Jungle Cruise, 2021, 6.6, A visually rich but formulaic adventure that leans heavily on its leads’ chemistry. The humor lands well, but the plot feels overly familiar.
The Mummy, 1999, 8.1, A delightful mix of action, adventure, and horror, featuring charming performances and excellent practical effects. A timeless and rewatchable classic.
The Mummy, 1999, 6.5, Fun and fast-paced but suffers from cheesy dialogue and some outdated CGI. While entertaining, it doesn’t quite hold up to modern adventure standards.
Tomb Raider, 2018, 6.3, A solid attempt to reboot the franchise with a more grounded approach, but it lacks the excitement and charm of the classic adventure films it aims to emulate.
